#Paradigms of Computer Vision
*Hannah Dee, 02/10/15*

##What is (Computer) Vision?

Going from an *image* to and *understanding of what is in that image*

##How Do We See?

* We see using a very specialised part of the brain
* Finding out how vision works is difficult. We can:
    * Perform experiments on live biological entities
    * Use diseased or damaged brains (e.g. visual cortex damage)
    * Use of perceptual illusions and oddities - optical illusions can give us a great understanding of how our vision works

##Two Streams Hypothesis

* Visual information is collected at the cortex
* Some information goes down the "What" pathway, the Ventral Stream
* Other information goes down the "Where" pathway, the Dorsal Stream
* There will be some crossover and communication of information

##Visual Shortcuts

These are some assumptions the human brain appears to make when dealing with vision:
* The light source is always from above
* Borders of objects are usually convex
* We usually don't view an object from below - recognising objects from underneath is generally difficult
* Lines are expected to be continuous
* Faces are upright

##Gestalt

The Gestalt group came up with some rules about vision:

* **Proximity**
    * Your perception will automatically group things
* **Similarity**
    * Something that doesn't fit will automatically pop out
* **Closure**
    * Your brain will fill in the borders of shapes automatically, even if the borders do not exist

##Expectation

Our expectation of what we are going to see greatly influences what we actually see. This is particularly true when it comes to the phenomenon called "Change Blindness"

If we don't expect to see something, we often will not see it, or it will take some time for us to notice it.

##Human Vision Vs. Computer Vision
###Human Vision

* Good news - we (humans) are excellent at seeing!
* But only if it's what we're attending to
* Vision is:
    * Stereo
    * Parallel
    * Foveal
    * Attentive
    * Integrated
    * Has motion-specific pathways
* Vision also makes some interesting mistakes, which offer clues as to how it works

###Machine Vision Is Different!
* Stereo is optional
* It's very occasionally parallel
* It's *very* rare to see foveal machine vision
* It's not really attentive
* There are very rarely integrated systems for vision
* Motion vision is usually separate
