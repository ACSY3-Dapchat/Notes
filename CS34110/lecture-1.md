#Computer Vision: Introduction
*Hannah Dee*

##What is Computer Vision?
* Not unrelated to Image Processing
* Going from an image to understanding what is depicted in it
* However the meaning of "understanding" is unclear

##What We Are Going To See
* Paradigms
    * What is Computer Vision?
    * "Understanding" images can have different meanings
    * Evaluation - how do we know it's worked?
* Image Formation
    * Image geometry
    * Radiometry
    * Digitisation
* Edge and Feature Detection
    * Edge formation and Detection
    * Grouping of edge pixels
    * Features in images & their detection
    * Appearance and patch-based "features"
* Motion
    * Optical flow
    * Motion detection
* Objects
    * Representation
    * Recognition
* Shape From X
    * Shading
    * Texture & Occlusions
* Stereo Vision
    * Correspondence
    * Stereo vision & structure from motion
* 3D Vision
    * Data capture & registration
    * Sensor motion estimation (motion tracking)

Computer vision can be an abstract mathematical subject with major real-world applications.
