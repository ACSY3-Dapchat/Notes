Internet Services Admin: Price, Quality, Service - choose any two
====

Physical security - not advertising what you have inside

Change management is important:
  * things could break
  * costs money on downtime
  * keep things running on minimum amount of money

IT is not always the best solution:
  * Keys stop X-ray firing
  * Safer than a piece of software (which may have a bug)
  * If key is removed to open a door, x-ray will not fire

#### Customer Service
* Generally more negative feedback than positive
* How to manage lack-of-expectation
* Would a truly bad company still be in business?
* Be truthful:
  * Constrained by budget
  * Constrained by law
  * Constrained by rules
  * etc...
