Space Robotics: Future of Space Robotics
=====

### The road back to Mars (post Beagle 2)

Every 2 earth years:
* best time to go to Mars
* every odd year (roughly)

#### NASA Mars Telecom Orbiter:
* 2009
* Didn't go ahead
* Utilise lasers to transmit Gigabits of data
* Instead, each orbiter has better comms.
  * Mostly through Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter

#### Future (some past now...)
* Mars Scout - *2011*
* Mars Sample Return - *2013*
* Astrobiology Field Lab / Mars 2020:
  * Deep drill
  * Proposed landing site is a crater with a lot of water history
  * *2018*
* Mars Scout - *2016/2020*

#### ESA Aurora Program:
* Manned and Unmanned space exploration
* ExoMars is first flagship Robot
* Have to find benefits to community in the mission:
  * Stimulate new technologies
  * Inspire young people (outreach)


##### ESA Initial Roadmap:
*2007* Entry Vehicle Demonstrator (ExoMars 2016)
*2009* ExoMars (2018)
*2011* Mars Sample Return (2020+)
*2014* Mars Sample Return 2
*2014* Human Mission Technologies Demonstrators (ISS)
*2018* Technological pre-cursor mission (tech -> Mars for humans)
*2024* Human Moon Mission (China interested)
*2026* Automatic Mars Mission
*2030* Cargo to Mars
*2033* First humans to Mars

##### Why two Sample Return missions?
First = rover. caches findings somewhere
Second:
* Minimal payload retrieval system & return system, take fuel or make it from ice there?
* Returns to Earth
* Probably not enough mass to get back to Earth
* Suggested transfer to another orbiter
* How would you safely land this?

##### BeagleNET
* Proposal same time at ExoMars
* Reuse Beagle technology
* second two with different landing locations
* Not rover
* Detection of carbon/methane - what produced it
* Mars geologically active? Seismometers
* Probe Mars' internal structure
* Climate & Weather patterns
* 2 landers on one orbiter
* Lander packed inside like Viking - heat shield & thrusters
* Mandatory for simple telemetry upon approach with ESA
* Aerial on top - so can't use bouncing gas bags
* Used dead-beat gasbag instead:
  * like landing tanks
  * deploys just before landing
  * uses stored N2 gas
  * proposed for ExoMars (much heavier than BeagleNET)
* Solar Panels:
  * Folder concetina
  * Out sideways
  * Antenna on top
  * ~2-3m length

> Look up Altair Engineering

* Robotic arm on Lander
* Fetch rover to obtain samples (4 wheels)
* Stereo cameras
* Lander relay instructions to rover
* X-ray spectrometer
* 'Mole' - digging instrument, down to 2m, winched back up, put on Fetch rover

**Didn't get funding**

* Getting off a lander is difficult for a rover
* Rover drops off a seismic monitor (spikes in the bottom)
* Returns samples to lander, collected by arm and delivered to lab on lander
