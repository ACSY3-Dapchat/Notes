Space Robotics: Space Robotics Fact vs Fiction
====

## With respect to Space Robotics, has science fact lived up to science fiction?

> Quite often an exam question

* R2D2 & C3PO (AI & Humanoids) - seemingly not there yet
* Mechanical is close - good & quite mobile
* Lack of humanoid - non-humanoid structures tend to fair better, easier to focus on getting what we need
* NASA & ESA experimenting with just a torso - [Robonaut](http://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/default.asp)

* Hard to move around on planetary surface - lots of obstacles, not always as smooth as portrayed in Movies
* Difficult to actually get into space & between planets
  * No teleporters / warp-drives etc
* Do have ion thrusters & solar sails
* Fully autonomous is a long way off
  * Semi-autonomous tends to be faster
  * Can do harder jobs via human control
* Not yet living spaceman & robot in harmony - psychological reasons
