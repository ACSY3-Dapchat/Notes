Space Robotics: History of Space
=====
Space & Planetary robotics includes:
* Space probes
* Orbiters and satellites
* Landers and rovers, plus manipulators
* On orbit free-flying manipulator robots (servicing)

#### Space Race
* USSR vs USA
* UK had minor role
  * ['British Space Race - BBC Documentary'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW5X8dhxA_8)

> Could we use Robotics to clear up the Space rubbish and debris?

#### Robotic Spacecraft:
* deep space probes of all types
* emphasis on planetary explorers
* space telescopes too (Hubble etc.)
* unmanned
* significant degree of autonomy

#### Swift:
* Gamma Ray observatory
* Bursts anywhere in the sky
* Autonomously figures out where, sends data to earth and triggers earth telescopes
* ~1,000 bursts recorded

#### Robotic Manipulators:
* Emulate human manipulation
* Uses:
  * Free-flyers
  * On-orbit servicing of other spacecraft
  * Acquisition of samples

#### Robotic Rovers:
* Aerobots
* Cryobots - for ice
* Hydrobots - for liquid
* Emulate human mobility:
* Uses:
  * Terrestrial planets
  * Planetary atmospheres
  * Moons
  * Penetration of ice/liquid

#### Enceladus:
* 6th largest moon of Saturn

* Plumes of water vapour & ice

  * USSR & other
* Vikings 1&2:
  * Landed on Mars
  * Launched 1976
  * Analysed gases in the atmosphere and chemicals in the soil
  * Looked for life - inconclusive
  * Useful readings even now for missions
  * Used power descent
  * Cameras on boards
  * Live-scan cameras, rotating turret
  * No solar panels, used nuclear battery
  * Thermal regulation important (too hot/cold)
* Voyager 1&2:
  * Still operational
  * Travelling out of the solar system
  * Last until at least 2020
  * Slingshots around planets to the next
  * Voyager 1 - Jupiter & Saturn -> Titan
  * Voyager 2 - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Tritan
  * 38 years later... only send data about magnetic field (to save battery)
* Mars Global Surveyer:
  * Elliptical capture orbit
  * 12th September 1997
  * Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC)
  * Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) - topographic mapper, now broken
* Mars Pathfinder:
  * Landed on Mars
  * 4th July 1997
  * Impacted at ~18m/s (40mph) & bounced ~15m into the air
  * Bounced another 15 times
  * Landed 1km from impact site
  * Rover & Lander
  * 6-wheel rover (Sojourner)
  * Lander had a better Camera
  * Wrapped in gas-bags to bounce
  * Mechanisms deployed to ensure lander was right way up
  * Rover had x-ray spectrometer, small Camera
  * Drove ~10m from lander, commands relayed from lander

* Mars Odyssey:
  * 2001
  * Still in use
  * Orbiter
  * Images in Infrared
  * Gamma ray spectrometer
  * NASA
  * Can detect hydrogen (hydrogen could = water)
  * 19m/pixel - high-res images, could see river structures

> MOLA Altimeter suggested large quantities of water on Mars

> Beagle 2 used Viking data to plan landing area

* ESA Mars Express:
  * EU Orbiter
  * 2003
  * Lightweight
  * Had to add more instruments to get to predicted weight (by about 120kg)
  * Took Beagle 2
  * Camera HRSC (high-res stereo camera)
  * 3D images
  * Used aero-braking to slow into Mars atmosphere & orbit

> Mars Odyssey used for Beagle 2 data relay while Mars Express slowed it's orbit

> Frangibolts = explosive bolts

> Outgassing = trapped gas & vapour escaping, could recondense as ice, if a lot escaping, could make mini-thruster

> Push room camera

> Northern pole of Mars has ice & frost (CO2)

* Mars Exploration Rovers:
  * Spirit & Opportunity
  * 2004
  * USA
  * Part of the Exploration programme
  * Lots of instruments on board
  * 6-wheeled
  * Parachute & airbag landing
  * Spirit died
  * Opportunity still alive - bad wheel so driving backwards, has traveled ~40km
  * Must have strategy for surviving winter (shelter behind slope)

> High-gain antenna can talk to earth if needed

> Low-gain antenna more used, talks to passing satellites

* NASA Phoenix:
  * 2008
  * Lander
  * Exploring Martian Arctic
  * South pole particularly icy (Water & CO2 ice)
  * Follows Mars Polar Lander - which crash Landed
  * Went to the North Pole
  * Stereo camera with filter wheels
  * Chemical lab on-board (ovens, filters, microscope)
  * Chemistry of soil, study of the water
  * Lasted ~5months
  * Frozen water confirmed, falling 'snow' observed
  * Liquid water not on Mars - pressure too low
  * Salty & quite alkali soil
* Eurobot:
  * On-orbit servicing
  * 2004
  * ESA
  * 3 arms, 2 to hold on, 1 to fix/service
  * International Space Station
  * Can use a calibrated robot arm to simulate lack of gravity in training
    * Or water bath
    * Parabolic planets

> Also Canadarm, NASA's on-orbit servicer

* Sky Crane:
  * Jets & powered-descent
  * Lowered Curiosity down
  * Once deployed, cut cords and crash land far away
  * Would've contaminated the surrounding area with excess fuel - didn't want Curiosity also contaminated by going to look for it

> Curiosity was too big for airbags & platform causes other issues

* Mars 2020:
  * NASA
  * 2020
  * Assessment of past habitability
  * Possibility of life on Mars
