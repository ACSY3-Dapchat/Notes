##What is Ubiquitous Computing?

Ubiquitous computing can have several different names, including:
* Pervasive computing
* Ambient intelligence
* Everyware

It describes a type of computing that:
* Distributes computing all around us
* Provides facilities that you don't realise you're using
* Augments aspects of life transparently

Most of these will be embedded, low-power systems, and as such will rarely have a desktop or even a command line.

Marc Weiser described the evolution of computing as:
* Phase 1: Mainframes (1 computer : Many people)
* Phase 2: Personal Computers (1 computer : 1 person)
* Phase 3: Ubiquitous Computing (Many computers : 1 person)

##Examples
* Car
    * Engine Management System
    * ABS
    * Keyfob
* Video/DVD/Digital TV
* Kitchen appliances
