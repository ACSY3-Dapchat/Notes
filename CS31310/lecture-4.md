#Introducing Scrum
*Neil Taylor, 0.26 Biology Main*

##Scrum
* Has it's roots in a 1986 paper by Takeuchi and Nonaka, "The new new product development game"
    * Observations of companies, inc. Honda and NEC
* Developed in the early 90's
* Formalised by Sutherland and Schwaber in 1995 for paper at OOPSLA

##"Moving the Scrum Downfield"
* The paper identifies six characteristics in product development
    * Built-in instability
    * Self-organising project teams
    * Overlapping development phases
    * Multilearning
    * Subtle control
    * Organisational transfer of learning

##What Is Scrum?

*"Scrum(n)": A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems while productivels and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value."*

##Scrum Theory
###Three Pillars
* **Transparency**
    * Everyone involved in delivering the project should understand what is expected and how the process works.
* **Inspection**
    * Review the outputs at regular intervals
* **Adaptation**
    * Change the process if it is not working, or is not delivering a sensible result

###Scrum Team Roles
* **Product Owner**
    * "Responsible for maximising the value of the product and the work of the development team." One person, not a committee.
* **Development Team**
    * Necessary skills to successfully deliver the product.
    * Self-organising
    * Cross-functional (looking for a range of skills)
* **Scrum Master**
    * Support for the Product Owner, the Development Team and the Organisation. *Not about management*

###Scrum Events
* **The Sprint**
    * A fixed time (time-box) in which the team produces a "Done" product increment
* Meetings
    * **Sprint Planning**
        * What can be done in the sprint?
        * How will it get done?
        * Sprint Goal
    * **Daily Scrum**
        * Stand-up meeting
        * The team talks about the previous day, what could be improved etc.
    * **Sprint Review**
    * **Sprint Retrospective**
        * Not thinking about the *product*, but thinking about the *process*
        * Is the team working well?

###Scrum Artifacts
* Backlog
    * Everything that is needed in the project - e.g. features and fixes
* It is an ordered list of requirements
    * Details need to be "refined"
* Different aspects:
    * Product backlog
    * Sprint backlog
* Are the artifacts "transparent"?
    * Is there are a good understanding in the team about what is going to be done?

A burn-down chart is a good way of keeping track of where you are within a project, and let you know when you are drifting from your estimates.

###Where *is* the detail?
* Nothing about practices in the Scrum guide
* What is "Done"?
* There are rules, e.g.
    * No one but the Product Owner can cancel a sprint
    * The stand-up meeting is 15 minutes
    * The review is 3-hours
* Do we need the rest of the detail?
* How do we ensure that we deliver useful, "Done", value for the customer?
