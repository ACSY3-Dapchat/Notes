# \#1 Introduction (I can help you deliver your software projects on time)
*Neil Taylor (28/09/15)*

* 3 Worksheets + 1 exam weighted 10% for the worksheets + 90% for the exam

## Top Level topics
* eXtreme programming (XP)
* Test driven development
* Refactoring
* Continuous Integration
* Feature driven development, Scrum, Kanban
* Plan Driven
* Boehm's discussion on choosing the right methodology. He was the author of
the Spiral model.

## Other
* Ken Beck is the author behind XP where he stated that all knowledge about
software is wrong.
* Is Agile the self help manual?
* Projects spiral out of control, mention by Fred, is Agile the help guide for
this?
* Why Software fails the IEEE spectrum, down to requirements. [paper link](http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/why-software-fails)
* 2012 RBS Software glitch
  * **Rumour**: Planned update broke, so there was no easy rollback
  * [Article link](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18561426)

## NHS IT Systems
* Patient record management
* Rolled out to over 220 NHS trusts
* Cost £3.1bn for 220
* Project was killed and only spent £2.2bn for 22 trusts

## No Silver Bullet
* Fred Brooks said the accident is side issues, such as better programming
languages, better quality, more efficient and cheaper.
* Essence of the problem:
  * Developers
  * Customers
  * Poor processes.
  * Poor cross communication between developers.
  * Trade off for the "perfect system" vs "cheap"
  * Bad Management
  * Core Complexity of the program is potentially the largest factor
  * Miscommunication when working out what is needed, often delivering the wrong
  software
  * 35% of requiements change from the start / during the process
  * Waterfall makes you fearful of changing your mind. Customers are often asked
  to make sure that the requirements are 100% correct as there is little room
  for change.

Barry Boehm Suggested perhaps it's a range of methodologies we need?

## Manefesto for Agile
2001 a group of independent devs came together to produce a set of "rules"
* **Individuals and Interactions** over processes and tools. Lots of
communication
* **Working Software** over comprehensive documentation. Too much UML
* **Customer Collaberation** over contract negotiation. Interactions with
clients' is important
* **Responding to change** over following a plan. Too much planning, often with
false assumptions about requirements.

They state that there is value in the right, but the left statements are more
important to them.

Organisations shouldn't decide tools. Teams choice > Company procedure. The
team should realise the programming languages and items need.

Agile Manefesto was formed over 10 years ago,

## Dr Westen paper on waterfall

Design is really important, and you need to do design before the analysis. This
helps to understand the problem more. Prototype is important for this concept

Documentation is important. For a £5 million project expect a 1500 page spec

Is software really like building a house for complexity?
