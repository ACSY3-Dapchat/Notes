##The Agile Manifesto
"We have come to value"
* **Individuals and Interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

Analysis and coding are important, but if a large project only uses those steps it is doomed to fail.
